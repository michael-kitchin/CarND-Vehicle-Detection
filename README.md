**Vehicle Detection Project**

## Writeup

### Introduction

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Perform Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images to train a Linear SVM classifier.
* Use your trained classifier coupled with a sliding-window technique to search for vehicles in images.
* Run this pipeline on a video stream to create heat maps (integrations) of recurring detections for outlier rejection and vehicle following.
* Estimate and render bounding boxes for vehicles detected.

### Environment

Minimum execution environment is undefined.
